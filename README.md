# Kappa-Guitars
Design and implementation of a static UI/UX for a guitar store website
both for desktop and mobile. 

This was a project for the course CS-364 at Computer Science Department, 
University of Crete.

It was developed by myself in collaboration with Alex Staridas, 
a fellow Computer Science student.

What we were asked to do, was first to design and then implement the
following basic pages for our website:

-Homepage
-Categories page
-Product page
-Search page
-Artist page

In addition to that we implemented a "Custom Shop" and an "Under Construction"
page in order to make the UX a little more pleasant.

During the design phase we used Figma, a tool for UI design.
The implementation of our pages was done with the use of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

We were not obliged to provide any responsiveness to our pages but we played around
with some JS to provide some responsiveness to our "Search" Page.
